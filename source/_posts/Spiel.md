<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;"> &emsp;&emsp;Black and white dreams often happen to older people, recalling a time when the color of the media was not so predominant in the daily life of a person. Symbols are the language of dreams. Thus bringing out the popularity of dream decoder dictionaries. Moods, memory, unconscious thought are shown through dreams. This only feeds mans favorite question that is… Why? 
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;">
&emsp;&emsp;Disturbing dreams are most likely caused by childhood memories or problems. The most common nightmare occurring to most is being chased. For most children it is an animal or some kind of fantasy figure. Adults experience being chased by an unknown male figure. Nightmares are more easily studied than happy dreams. What does this say about society? That our world causes us problems even when we are in a perfect place of dreamland? Does the study of nightmares suggest that happy dreams are the anomaly?

&emsp;&emsp;I love to dream, both awake and asleep. I find it’s the best way to explore ones mind, to simply think. I find the idea of a dream to be one of the most fascinating things that is a part of human life. A dream can affect a person the next day. If a person spends the night in a perfect place created by their deepest wishes, it obviously helps a person mentally and physically recharge. But a nightmare can bring long forgotten memories from the past to the surface. The mind can be a perfect place recalling the best time of your life, but it can also force one to relive horror while their eyes are closed.

&emsp;&emsp;It makes me wonder what the most vicious people dreamt of, or what the so-called happiest dreamt of. I think to dream opens a person up to the things they don’t have time to think of during a normal day. Dream as often as possible. Dream of everything. Dream of who you’ll be, where you’ll go, whom you’ll meet. We can only control our dreams so much, but in our life we can act on what our subconscious wants through our daily life. Until then, sweet dreams.</span>
